  TODO
1. By changing only the display property of the CSS make all 3 squares line up horizontally like in goal1 image.
2. Change only the display property to make all 3 squares line up vertically like in goal2 image.

<!--
Display values:
> Inline: Elements are in the same line until the line is full (until the width of the webpage, then it will go to the next line)
> Block: One element is going to take up the entire full width (you cannot set the width and height, it is by default set to the length of the string)
> Inline block: Halfway point between the two above
    Block part enables us to set the width and height
    Inline part enables us to have elements that go onto the same line
> None: Any element with this display value disappear, which is useful if you e.g. have a button that hides an element or when you check an item in a todolist and you want it to disappear
-->

<!--
Exercise 1: Change all display values to inline-block
Exercise 2: Change all display values to block
