<!--
Absolute file path: The file path from the root i.e. C drive
Relative file path: The file path relative from e.g. this index.html file

In relative file path ../ means to go up a level and go into that folder
                      ./ means to stay in the current directory i.e. the current folder (you can also often not use the ./ 
                         and it will look in the current folder, this does not always work though)
