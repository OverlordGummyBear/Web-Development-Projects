<!--
The internal styling can apply to anywhere in the HTML document and inside we can target and select all the elements we want
Really useful to applying it to only one HTML document.
The css style is limited to the HTML it sits in, so it is useful if you only want to target a single webpage
If you have a multipage website, then this is not the recomended method.
